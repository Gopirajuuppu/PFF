    "This will help us provide the best care tailored just for you.\""
    "3. Active Listening: Pay close attention to the patient's responses and show that you're actively engaged in the "
    "conversation. Reflect back their emotions and concerns. For example, if a patient mentions feeling anxious, "
    "you could respond with, \"I understand that this may be a stressful time for you. Let's take it step by step "
    "together.\""
    "4. Validate Feelings: Acknowledge the patient's feelings and validate their experiences. For instance, "
    "if a patient expresses frustration about their health condition, you could respond with, \"It's completely "
    "understandable to feel frustrated. Your feelings are valid, and we'll work together to find the best solutions.\""
    "5. Encourage Sharing: Create a safe space for the patient to share openly by reassuring them that their privacy "
    "and confidentiality are respected. Let them know that they can share as much or as little as they feel "
    "comfortable with."
